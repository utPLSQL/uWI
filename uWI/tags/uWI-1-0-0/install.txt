1. Introduction
===============
This document contains instructions on how to get utPLSQL Web Interface (uWI) running on your server.  

uWI is a (perl) CGI script and as such it does not require installation.  It just needs to be copied to your webserver's cgi-bin directory and you can run the script from your favorite browser.  However, for it to be able to run, you need to have some software pre-installed on your machine.  The software you need are:

   1. Perl (+ some perl mods)
   2. Apache
   3. Oracle Client (at least)
   
The remainder of this document will help you installing this software on your server should you not have everything yet.


2. Installing Perl
==================
As uWI is a perl CGI script, you need to have perl installed on your server.  How do you know if you have perl installed?  Just run the following command from a command prompt:

perl -v

If perl is installed, this will return the version.  If not, you'll get an error message and you need to install perl.  I personally use Perl ActiveState (http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/) but you can install any distribution you prefer.  If you install perl on your C: drive (C:\perl) then you can skip step 6 in these notes.

3. Installing DBI
=================
After you have installed perl, you will need to install some perl modules that are being used by uWI.  These are necessary to be able to connect to your Oracle Database.  You will need:

DBI
DBD-Oracle

When you are using ActivePerl, you can verify if you already have these modules by issuing the following commands from the command prompt:

ppm query DBI
ppm query DBD-Oracle

If these queries return no matches then you will have to install these packages before proceeding.  You can find perl packages on the CPAN website (http://search.cpan.org/), just look for DBI and DBD::Oracle.  Installing with ActiveState is a breeze, just issue the following commands at a command prompt:

ppm install DBI

Unfortunately, DBD::Oracle is not distributed anymore by ActiveState so you will have to get it from a different ppm server.  I use http://ftp.esoftmatic.com/outgoing/DBI/ Just pick the directory that matches your perl version (if you have a perl version higher than 5.8.4 use 5.8.4).  Download the following file:

http://ftp.esoftmatic.com/outgoing/DBI/5.8.4/DBD-Oracle-1.16-5.8.4.tar.gz
http://ftp.esoftmatic.com/outgoing/DBI/5.8.4/DBD-Oracle.ppd

Then, in the directory where saved these files, you can run:

ppm install DBD-Oracle

NOTE: You HAVE to install DBI BEFORE you install the DBD-Oracle module.  Also note that the server on which you install these modules MUST have at least the Oracle Client Software installed on it in order for the DBD-Oracle module to build correctly.

4. Installing Apache
====================
Since this is an Web Application, you will have to run a webserver to be able to serve the application to your users.  Just go to http://httpd.apache.org/ and get the Apache server version of your choice.  Verify that the installation worked ok and that you are able to serve static webpages (this is described in detail in the installation notes of Apache).  If this works you are almost ready to run uWI.

5 Configuring Apache
====================
Apache needs to be configured to allow it to run CGI scripts.  You can do this by opening the Apache Configuration File (httpd.conf) and adding the following lines:

#
# "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/cgi-bin" should be changed to where ever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
#
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/cgi-bin/"
<Directory "C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl

My httpd.conf is located in C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/conf but it depends on your version of Apache where yours is, just search in the Apache folders for httpd.conf.

6. Changing the uWI.pl File
===========================
Because I don't know where your perl executable is located, you are going to need to make a change to the uwi.pl file:

You need to change the so called hashbang line (aka she-bang line) which HAS to be the first line in all your perl scripts.  I deliver it as

#!C:/Perl/bin/Perl.exe

because that is where my perl.exe file lives, you will need to change it to your perl location e.g.

#!D:/MyPerlDirectory/bin/Perl.exe


7. Copy uWI file
================
uWI consists of just 1 perl script that you need to put in your Apache's cgi-bin directory and that's it.  If you want it to look at least a bit attractive, you also need to put the uwi.css in your HTML directory (usually ..\htdocs in the Apache's directory tree).  Now just point your browser to:

http://<your webserver's IP address or hostname>/cgi-bin/uwi.pl 

and you should see the uwi logon page.  Just logon to the DB using your utPLSQL user and you should see all the test suites that you have installed on that DB.  

Anybody who has access to your website can now use uWI.  They do not have to install anything, just give them the URL!

The steps described above are usually done by a WebMaster.  If you are already serving WebApplication that need connections to an Oracle DB he probably has already done all of this for you and you can just tell him to put the .pl file and the .css file in the right directories.

If you do not like the way uWI looks, you can customize the CSS file and make it look anyway you want.
